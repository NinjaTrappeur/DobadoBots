#Language spec

##Features

Main idea: we need a simple language with a simple syntax
which needs to be easily remembered. We want to teach logic
more than teaching programming here. The fun part will be
the bot competition, not the programming per say.

1. Conditionnal structure.
1. Basic boolean logic (==, !=, >, <).
1. Actions.
1. Conditions.

## Example

IF COND1 = 3
  ACTTON 1
ELSE
  IF COND2 = 4
    ACTION 2
  ELSE
    NOTHING

## Actions

- Move forward.
- Turn left.
- Turn right.
- Turn x degrees.
- Turn facing objective.
- Change objective.

## Conditions

- Distance up front.
- Type of object up front.
- Distance objective.
- Angle objective.
