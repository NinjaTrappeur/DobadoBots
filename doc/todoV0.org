                        - [ ] We need a data format for the arena level
                          (JSON?)
                        - [ ] We need to implement a parser + related tests
                          for this data format (using aeson?)
            - [ ] We need to implement a function computing game engine state
              evolution.
                  - [ ] We need to implement a function computing robots
                    movement.

                    movement.
                  - [ ] We need to implement a function computing collisions
                    between objects.
                        - [ ] We need to implement a bounding box based
                          collision checker.
                        - [ ] We need to implement a function checking bots
                          collisions against walls and between themselves.
                        - [ ] We need to implement a function checking bots
                          collisions against objectives.
                        - [ ] We need to implement a function checking bots
                          collisions with lasers.
                        - [ ] We need to implement a function checknig laser
                          collisions with walls.

* TODO We need a proper dobadobots ui.

  - [-] We need to display both the arena and the code.
        - [-] We need to implement an arena viewer.
              - [X] We need to display an empty window.
              - [ ] We need to display arena walls.
              - [ ] We need to display robots.
              - [ ] We need to display robots laser.
              - [ ] We need to display objective.
              - [ ] We need to display line between robot and objective.
        - [ ] We need to implement a text editor.
              - [ ] We need to implement an AST pretty printer.
              - [ ] We want a visual marker for the path currently executed.
